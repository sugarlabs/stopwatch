What is this?
=============

The StopWatch activity allows you to measure the amount of time something takes.  It shows a number of digital stopwatches.  Each stopwatch is independent.

Features include:

* synchronized collaborative timing through the Sugar collaboration system,
* saving stopwatches to the Journal ... even while they are still running!
* keyboard-navigable, with special accelerators for use on laptops in tablet mode,
* names for stopwatches for easy reference,
* mark-saving for important points during a timed session,
* very high CPU efficiency: uses no CPU time when not visible on-screen.
